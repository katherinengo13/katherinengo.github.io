<h3 id="dbcaption">"Design for America (DFA) is a national organization that enables small teams of students, from all majors, to create solutions for local issues using design thinking."</h3>
<p id="dbcaption">During the 2018-2019 school year, I joined <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dfaucsd/" target="_blank"><strong>Design for America at UC San Diego</strong></a>. In the organization, there multiple groups that work on different projects that aim to make social impact. I was apart of the <strong>Design for Seniors with Alzheimer's Disease</strong> group. Our main goal was to use human-centered design in order to improve the lives of Seniors with Alzheimer's.</p>

<h2 id="dbcaption"><u>Context</u></h2>
<h4 id="dbcaption"><strong>Focus:</strong> Alzheimer's Seniors and Caregivers</h4>
<h4 id="dbcaption"><strong>Why?</strong> Caregivers have a significant impact on the life of seniors with Alzheimer's Disease since they are responsible for their daily care and wellbeing.</h4>
<h4 id="dbcaption"><strong>Question:</strong> How can we improve cargivers and family members nonverbal communication with other caregivers and seniors with Alzheimer's Disease?</h4>
<p class="smallparagraph">We noticed a trend of a senior having multiple caregivers and often poor engagement between the caregiver and the senior.</p>

		<h4><strong>Familial Caregivers...</strong></h4>
		<p> - Don't always know much about the disease</p>
		<p> - Sometimes lack ideas/methods to interact with seniors with Alzheimer's</p>
		<p> - Have limited time</p>
		<p> - Need time to do errands or self care by themselves</p>
		<p> - Occassionally work with other caregivers and family</p>

<h4 id="dbcaption">After spending a lot of time brainstorming and critiquing, we came up with two feasible and relevant solutions:</h4>
<h4 id="dbcaption">1) A Potential Solution: <strong>Adaptive Clothing</strong></h4>
<h4 id="dbcaption"><strong>Why?</strong> To enable caregivers to quickly put on and remove clothing for immobile seniors.</h4>
<p class="smallparagraph">However, after attempting to make prototypes and looking more into the idea, we decided not to go through with this solution.</p>
<h4 id="dbcaption"><strong>Why it didn't work:</strong> The solution was not focused enough for people with Alzheimer's and it has already been done before. We also did not have the expertise, knowledge, and resources in order to effectively execute the project.</h4>

	<img src="img/dfa/clothing2.jpg" alt="clothing2" width="500px" class="imgcenter">
</div>
<h4 id="dbcaption">2) The Final Solution: <strong>Communication Board</strong></h4>
<h4 id="dbcaption"><strong>Why?</strong> To help caregivers communicate tasks completed with other caregivers and allow seniors with Alzheimer's to get a daily schedules of tasks that need to be done. This solution is meant to help caregivers working in homes.</h4>

<h4 id="dbcaption"><strong>AB Testing with caregiver support group</strong></h4>
<p class="smallparagraph">We gave the caregivers both of our initial prototypes and asked for feedback.</p>
<p class="smallparagraph"><strong><i>Findings:</i></strong> Wanted more simplicity, less novelty, and a focus on later stages of Alzheimer's Disease</p>

<h4 id="dbcaption"><strong>New Prototypes from Feedback</strong></h4>
<p class="smallparagraph">Changes: No calendar, removed switches, stickers instead of magnets</p>

<h4 id="dbcaption"><strong>Next Steps:</strong> Testing within the context of multiple caregivers and senior with Alzheimer's. Iterations and higher fidelity prototypes.</h4>

<h2 id="dbcaption"><u>Learn</u></h2>
<h3 id="dbcaption">Involving Stakeholders in the Design Process</h3>
<p class="smallparagraph">We used the stakeholders as resouces of information, rather than using them as codesigners. Co-desiging would have enabled a more impactful solution.</p>
<h3 id="dbcaption">Better Communication with our Stakeholders</h3>
<p class="smallparagraph">We were not able to interview many caregivers and we were not able to interview any seniors with Alzheimer's. It was difficult for us to narrow down the problem.</p>
<h3 id="dbcaption">Test Early, Test Often</h3>
<p class="smallparagraph">We did not get to test our prototype in the context it would have been used in. We learned that we should have prototyped earlier and in lower fidelity in order to allow for more iterations.</p>
