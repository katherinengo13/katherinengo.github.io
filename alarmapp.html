		<h1 class="centertext"> iPhone Alarm App Redesign </h1>
		<h4>"A useful application that is used everyday, but it could be better."</h4>
		<p>For a design project, my group and I decided to analyze the different errors and slips people make when using the iPhone Alarm App so that we could redesign different aspects of the app's usability.</p>
		<p><i>Note: I continued the project by creating high fidelity prototypes using Figma.</i></p>
		<h4><b>Role:</b> UX Researcher and Designer</h4>

		<h2>Data Collection</h2>
		<p>We decided to use an interview methodology as well as ask the interviewees to perform a list of actions. Before following the list of instructions, we asked each interviewee a couple of questions.</p>
		<h4 ><u>Interview Questions(Pre-activity)</u></h4>
		<p>1. Do you own an Android or an iPhone? <br>2. Do you use the alarm on the phone? <br>3. Have you used the iPhone clock app as an alarm before?<br><span id="tab">a. If so, how often?</span><br>4. Why/why do you not use an alarm?<br><span id="tab">a. If not, what do you usually use as an alarm?<br>b. How often?</span><br>5. What are you general thoughts on the iPhone clock app?</p>	
		<p id="tab">We asked interviewees if they used an Android or iPhone because those who own iPhones would naturally know more about the functionality and interface of the alarm app versus someone who owns an Android. When we aked if they have used an iPhone alarm, we wanted to gauge whether they had background knowledge or experience with the app which would therefore affect how they use the app.</p>

		<h4><u>List of Instructions</u></h4>
		<img src="img/instructions.png" alt="instructions" style="width: 450px" class="imgcenter">
		<p class="centertext">We wrote out these different steps of instructions because we wanted to cover all the different functions of the app and observe how the interviewees interact with these different functions.</p>
		<h4><u>Interview Questions(Post-activity)</u></h4> 
		<p>After the interviewees performed the list of actions, we followed up with more questions.</p>
		<p>1. After completing these steps, what are your general thoughts about the app?<br>2. If they made any specific errors/actions, we would ask them why they think they made that error/action.</p>

		<h2>Data</h2>
		<p>Our group interviewed a total of 14 people, which consisted of 8 iPhone users and 6 Android users. We analyzed different errors that seemed to occur during the interviews and kept count of how many interviewees made each error.</p>

		<h2>Redesign</h2>
		<h4>For our redesign, we focused on 3 different aspects on the app to redesign.</h4>

			<p class="centertext"><i>Wireframes for the redesigns.</i></p>

		<div class="alarmredesigngrid">
			<div>
				<img src="img/alarmappredesign1.gif" alt="deletemult" style="width: 300px" class="imgcenter">
				<h4 class="centertext">Checking off multiple alarms.</h5>
			</div>
			<p style="padding-left: 30px">For our first redesign, we decided to design a function of <strong>deleting multiple alarms at once</strong>. This function is based off a checklist so that the user can efficiently delete alarms. The user simply presses "Edit" and then the check boxes appear so that the user can select the alarms and then delete them all at once when the user clicks on the trash can icon.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="alarmredesigngrid">
			<div>
				<img src="img/alarmappredesign2.gif" alt="taptoedit" style="width: 300px" class="imgcenter">
				<h4 class="centertext">Tap to edit the alarm.</h4>
			</div>
			<p style="padding-left: 30px">The most common error that interviewees made trying to tap the alarm to edit it. So for our redesign, we propose that rather than pressing 'edit' then choosing the alarm the user wishes to edit, <strong>the user should be able to press the alarm directly</strong> and enter the edit settings of the alarm. This would simplify the layout and reduce the amount of tapping users would have to do in order to edit an alarm.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="alarmredesigngrid">
			<div>
				<img src="img/alarmappredesign3.gif" alt="typein" style="width: 300px" class="imgcenter">
				<h4 class="centertext">Typing in the time.</h4>
			</div>
			<p style="padding-left: 30px">Since one of the most common errors people made was accidentally scrolling past certain times they meant to set for their alarms, we decided to <strong>redesign the way users set the times for their alarms</strong>. Instead of incorporating a scrolling function, our allows the user to type in the time. This enables the user to ensure precision.</p>
