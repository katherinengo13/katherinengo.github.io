	<h1 class="centertext"> iPhone Alarm App Redesign </h1>
	<h3 id="dbcaption"><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> collecting data, conducting interviews, redesigning functions</h3>
	<div id="dbcaption">
		<h2>Data Collection</h2>
		<p>We decided to use an interview methodology as well as ask the interviewees to perform a list of actions. Before following the list of instructions, we asked each interviewee a couple of questions.</p>
		<h4 >Interview Questions(Pre-activity)</h4>
		<p>1. Do you own an Android or an iPhone?</p>
		<p>2. Do you use the alarm on the phone?</p>
		<p>3. Have you used the iPhone clock app as an alarm before?</p>			<p id="tab">a. If so, how often?</p>
		<p>4. Why/why do you not use an alarm?</p>
		<p id="tab">a. If not, what do you usually use as an alarm?</p>
		<p id="tab">b. How often?</p>			
		<p>5. What are you general thoughts on the iPhone clock app?</p>
		<p id="tab">We asked interviewees if they used an Android or iPhone because those who own iPhones would naturally know more about the functionality and interface of the alarm app versus someone who owns an Android. When we aked if they have used an iPhone alarm, we wanted to gauge whether they had background knowledge or experience with the app which would therefore affect how they use the app.</p>
		<h4>List of Instructions</h4>
		<p>insert pic of instructions here</p>
		<p id="tab">We wrote out these different steps of instructions because we wanted to cover all the different functions of the app and observe how the interviewees interact with these different functions.</p>
		<p>After the interviewees performed the list of actions, we followed up with more questions.</p>
		<h4>Interview Questions(Post-activity)</h4> 
		<p>1. After completing these steps, what are your general thoughts about the app?</p>
		<p>2. If they made any specific errors/actions, we would ask them why they think they made that error/action.</p>
		<h2>Data</h2>
		<p>insert data tables!</p>
		<h2>Error Analysis</h2>
		<p>Interviewee tapping on the bar to try to edit the alarm</p>
		<p>Interviewee making a slip and scrolling AM or PA when they really wanted to scroll through minutes</p>
		<p>Interviewee tapping on the wrong day</p>
		<h2>Redesign</h2>
		<h4>For our redesign, we focused on 3 different aspects on the app to redesign.</h4>
		<h4 class="centertext">Checking off multiple alarms.</h5>
		<h4 class="centertext">Typing in the time.</h4>
		<h4 class="centertext">Tap to edit the alarm.</h4>
