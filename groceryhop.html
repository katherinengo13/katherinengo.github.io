        <h4 class="ghheading">Background</h4>
        <div>
            
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has quickly changed everyone’s lives. Grocery shopping has become the only time people leave their homes, but it is a <span class="orangehighlight">difficult and intimidating task</span>. People must be in public with other individuals and touch items that strangers have touched. Although there is social distancing - the task of grocery shopping has become an <span class="orangehighlight">anxious and stressful experience</span> for everyone. Individuals should be able to shop efficiently and safely. People should be able to get in and out of grocery stores quickly, while still gathering enough the items they need.</p>
            <p>Currently, the only time people leave their homes is to go grocery shopping, where people must <span class="orangehighlight">shop with caution</span> in order to maintain social distancing. Grocery shopping is essential, but also risky because people go out in public during a time when it is encouraged to stay inside our homes. I decided to work on creating a <span class="orangehighlight">grocery shopping app</span> that aims to help individuals shop efficiently and safely during this pandemic.

        <div>
            <p>This project was challenging, but fun to make. Working on GroceryHop was a good learning experience, where I was able to practice my prototyping and UI design skills. I was able to learn more about Figma, the prototyping tool I used, and explore my creative side as I worked on the visual design and style of the app.</p>
            <p>Something I learned about through this project →  <b>You don’t need to commit to one design</b>.
                During the process of GroceryHop, I had sketched out all the screens and moved onto low fidelity prototypes and then high fidelity prototypes. While working on the high fidelity prototypes - I found myself feeling unmotivated to work on them. I then realized I was feeling unmotivated because I was not happy with the design of the app - and even when I realized this, I found it hard to let go of the current design I was working on because I had already created sketches and lofi prototypes with this design. But I decided to completely redesign GroceryHop. I spent an entire day, glued to my screen, redesigning the app. Although it was tiring, and I didn’t follow the whole “plan” -  it was okay. Redesigning the app and not committing to the original design taught me that it is okay to not follow your sketches. It is okay to admit to yourself that you are dissatisfied with the design.</p>
             <p>Moving forward with GroceryHop, I hope to be able to conduct more user testing and to have the user testing take place in grocery stores - where individuals can test out GroceryHop real time. </p>   
            <p>GroceryHop was a challenging and fun learning experience - where I was able to practice and learn many important design skills.</p>
