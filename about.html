		<p>Hey there, thanks for checking out my page. My name is Katherine and I am a product designer studying in sunny San Diego. I want to use design to help diverse communities! I believe that design can be applied to all aspects of life and is an impactful process that can improve the lives of anyone, anywhere. I enjoy learning about different people and identifying issues that can be resolved with design.</p>
		<p>Intertwined with product design, I like to spend my free time improving my web development skills as I am also an aspiring developer (Shoutout to w3schools and Udemy).</p>
		<p>If I'm not designing or coding, you can find me lifting weights at the gym, paddling on a dragon boat, or playing fetch with my Poodle Terrier.</p>
