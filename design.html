		<h3>Every Fall, The UCSD Dragon Boat Team recruits new members to the team. As PR chair & designer, I was in charge of marketing our Fall 2019 Recruitment. </h3>
		<p> I designed the flyer, which was posted all over the school, shared on social media, and passed out to people all over campus. I wanted one side of the flyer to showcase pictures of our team that reflect our motto - <strong>"Pride, Tradition, Passion"</strong>. For the other side, I kept the same color scheme when designing how the recruitment events would be presented.</p>

	<h3> The UCSD Dragon Boat Team is known for having a different jersey design every year. </h3>
	<p>As designer, I worked on the new jersey design for 2019-2020. I worked in collaboration with another designer, Brendan Jew. We worked on different designs and we constantly communicated with board members of the team when designing the jersey. We showed different designs and asked for feedback, shared potential designs and had individuals vote on the ones they liked best, and also considered their votes on specific details of the jersey, such as the texture. Our final product consisted of a tank top, short sleeve, and long sleeve design. We revealed the new jerseys to the entire team at the first race of the season, College Cup 2019. </p>

	<h3> "HackXX is a women-centric hackathon that provides a collaborative, inclusive space for all to explore technology and apply their talents."</h3>
	<p>I was one of the organizers that contributed to planning HackXX, a women-centric hackathon (open to all genders) based in San Diego, CA. I was part of two committees - the marketing committee and the design committee. For the marketing committee, I assisted in marketing the event on social media, around UCSD campus, and to other schools and organizations. For the design committee, I helped design some Facebook posts, a sticker, and the Snapchat filter.</p>
