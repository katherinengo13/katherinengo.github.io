<h1 class="centertext"> The Design Lab: Seaport Village Project </h1>
<p id="dbcaption"> During Summer 2019, I worked as a short term research assistant for the Design Lab. I worked on the Seaport Village Project, where the main goal was to take primary data and create a final deliverable for the Seaport Village Activation Project. I specifically worked on synthesizing the data. I went through all the data and organized strengths and concerns for each location(Seaport Village, Liberty Station, and Balboa Park) and used the data to organize personas.</p>
