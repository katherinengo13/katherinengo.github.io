	<div class="grid-layout2">
		<h4><span class="spheading">Background</span></h4>
		<p>As a college student myself, who spends some time figuring out which classes to take every quarter, I decided I wanted to learn more about how other people figure out which professor they should take for the quarter so that I can improve the experience. I then decided to go through the design process and create an app with two other UCSD students in order to create a community/review site where students can <span class="sphighlight">research their classes with confidence!</span></p>

		<h4><span class="spheading">Needfinding</span></h4>
		<p>In order to learn more about how students choose their classes, I decided to conduct interviews so that I can determine what are the specific needs students have when researching for their classes. I asked 3 individuals (1 alumni and 2 undergraduate students) to walk me through their process of how they choose their classes. I had them open up the websites they use and show me how they use them and why. I also asked them a few questions about <span class="sphighlight">reliability and trust</span> when it came to using different sources to gather information about their classes.</p>

		<h4><span class="spheading">Problem Statement:</span></h4>
		<h4>
		<span class="spheading2" style="padding-left: 0px;"> Students need to open many resources to decide which classes to take and when students use review websites, there is a lack of verification and trust. Students read reviews but are often unsure if the review is trustworthy or relevant to them as a student.</span>
		</h4>
		<h4><span class="spheading">Solution:</span></h4>
		<h4><span class="spheading2" style="padding-left: 0px;"> A review app that encourages more interactions between students utilizing the reviews and students writing the reviews. With reviewer profiles that provide a reviewer’s year, major, and classes, users can conclude if a review is trustworthy or relevant.</span></h4>

		<h4 class="spheading2">Reviewer Profiles</h4>
		<div>
			<p>According to the needfinding takeaways, students tend to trust their <span class="sphighlight">friends’ opinions</span> the most when deciding the classes. This is due to the <span class="sphighlight">personal connection</span> they have with their friends and the fact that they can ask their friends any question about the class or professor. So for the app, we decided to create reviewer profiles. Students are still able to write reviews anonymously, however, if they create an account then they can input some information about their student profile so that other students can see their <span class="sphighlight">major, year, and other classes</span> they took. <span class="sphighlight">Names are still completely anonymous.</span></p>
			<p>By incorporating reviewer profiles into the app, students are able to determine if a review is trustworthy or relevant to them. A student can read a review and know if the person that wrote the review is the same major as them, which can help determine if the content of the review is relevant to the student.

		<h4 class="spheading2">Q&A and Threads</h4>
		<div>
			<p>When a student is researching for their classes, they can have <span class="sphighlight">specific questions</span> about the class. We decided to make the SchoolProven more of an <span class="sphighlight">interactive community</span>, where students can communicate with each other and help each other answer questions about the class. </p>

				<div>
					<img src="img/sp-qa.png" alt="sp-qa" style="width: 200px;" class="imgcenter">

		<h4><span class="spheading">A/B Testing</span></h4>
		<div>
			<p>When we performed user testing on our functional prototype, we found that many users <span class="sphighlight">spent little time digesting the information that was presented to them</span>, whether it was reading the review, writing the review, or looking at a reviewer profile. In order to motivate users to spend more time on reviews, we decided to include the <span class="sphighlight">option to give endorsements</span> to reviewers when a user opens up a profile. We decided to create this new design in hopes that it would:</p>
			<img src="img/sp-abtest.jpg" alt="sp-abtest" class="imgcenter" style="width: 700px;">
			<br>
			<p>Although our constraints prevented us from directly measuring these 3 behaviors, we decided to determine if the new design should be incorporated by running an <span class="sphighlight">A/B Test</span> and measuring how long a user spends on the app.</p>
			<div class="grid-layout2-even">
				<div>
					<img src="img/sp-abtest-a.png" alt="sp-abtest-a" style="width: 200px;" class="imgcenter shadow">

					<p class="centertext">Design B: Reviewer profile with endorsements</p>
				</div>

			<!-- space -->
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>During the week that we ran the A/B test, we had a total of 39 users on our app. We set up our test to have 50/50 distribution of variants so that 50% of users would see the original design and the 50% of users would see the experimental design.</p>
			<p>Results showed that the <span class="sphighlight">average duration per session increased</span> in the experimental design over the original design, and so we decided to move forward with adding endorsements to our app.</p>
