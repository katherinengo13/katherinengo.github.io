	<h4 class="centertext"> <span class="ueheading">Redesigning Uber Eats to help support small local restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic</h4>
	<div class="grid-layout2">
        <h4><span class="ueheading">Background</span></h4>
        <p>During the pandemic, I have been trying to support small local restaurants by only ordering food from them. As I was using Uber Eats, I found myself having trouble finding out which business was local. I would come across a restaurant on the app that I was interested in ordering from, and then I would Google search the restaurant to try to find out if it is a small local restaurant or not. I found this to be an issue - not only because it required extra effort from me in order to learn more about a restaurant, but it made me think - <span class="grayhighlight">what about those who are not as aware of the struggles of small businesses?</span> There may be individuals using food delivery apps, not aware of the importance of ordering from small restaurants. This problem inspired me to create a redesign that would highlight the small local restaurants and their stories.</p>
		<h4><span class="spheading2">Impact</span></h4>
		<div>
			<img src="img/Uber Eats Redesign/undraw_empty_street_sfxm.png" alt="emptystreet" class="imgcenter" style="width: 300px;">
			<p>As stay-at-home orders prevent people from eating in at restaurants, many small local restaurants face an economic struggle. Many small restaurants are dependent on business in order to survive, so they are experiencing a hard hit due to the pandemic. </p>
			<p class="graybold centertext">“It’s very hard for a small business like ours to shut down for a few months and not do anything. We still have bills to pay.” </p>
			<p>Some local restaurants are even attempting to help those in need. For example, “Bacon Bacon” in San Francisco is encouraging people to support by offering an option to buy a meal for a healthcare professional at UCSF or Kaiser. Options like this help support a local spot that is struggling in business during the pandemic and at the same time, give to the individuals working the frontline.</p>

			<h4><span class="ueheading">How can we redesign the Uber Eats app so that it can encourage users to help support local restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic?</span></h4>
		</div>
		<h4><span class="ueheading">Interviews</span></h4>
		<p>I wanted to learn more about people supporting or not supporting small local businesses and how they interact with the Uber Eats app, so I conducted 2 interviews.</p>
		<h4><span class="spheading2">Takeaways</span></h4>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Special deals/discounts grab attention</p></li>
			<li><p>Learning more about the story of small restaurants would make the users more empathetic towards the restaurants</p></li>
			<li><p>Participants are aware of the struggles of small local restaurants</p></li>
		</ul>
		<h4><span class="ueheading">Issues with the Original Design</span></h4>
		<div>
			<p>In the interviews conducted, I wanted to learn more about how someone interacts with the UberEats app when trying to buy from small local restaurants. I gave the interviewees one task: <span class="grayhighlight">Find out how you can shop from small local restaurants using this app.</span> I then would ask them what they thought of the page and UberEats method.</p>
			<p>Here are the main issues I identified through the interviews and my own user experience:</p>
		</div>
		<p></p>
		<div class="grid-layout2-even">
			<img src="img/Uber Eats Redesign/homepage-before.png" alt="homepage-before" style="width: 200px;" class="imgcenter shadow">
			<div>
				<p class="graybold">Homepage</p>
				<p>Participants did not like the sliding banner, it made it <span class="grayhighlight">hard to focus on one banner</span><br> - Brings attention away from supporting local restaurants</p>
				<p>1 participant could not find the option to buy from local restaurants at all <br> - Their first instinct was to look at the tabs at the top of the screen</p>
				<p>Focus is on $0 Delivery fee <br>- Instead of supporting local spots</p>
			</div>
			<img src="img/Uber Eats Redesign/localpage-before.png" alt="localpage-before" style="width: 200px;" class="imgcenter shadow">
			<div>
				<p class="graybold">Local Restaurants Page</p>
				<p>Top paragraphs are a lot of plain text and <span class="grayhighlight">unappealing</span> <br> - Participants did not read this</p>
				<p>1 participant mentioned that they wish they can <span class="grayhighlight">sort and filter</span> on this page like how you can on the home page <br> - They want to filter the restaurants so that they display would cater more to what they want <br> - Said they would like this because they think it is annoying having to scroll all the way down the page to thoroughly explore the options</p>
			</div>

		<h4><span class="ueheading">Redesign Goals</span></h4>
		<div>
			<img src="img/Uber Eats Redesign/undraw_design_objectives_fy1r.png" alt="designgoals" class="imgcenter" style="width: 300px;">

		<h4><span class="ueheading">Reflection</span></h4>
		<div>
			<p>So far, this has been my favorite project to make. It was my first personal project! I worked on this solo and I was able to work on a topic I am passionate about. It was interesting to be able to become inspired by my own user experience and proceed into creating a redesign of an app I use.  This project required a lot of self discipline, since I had to create my own deadlines and plan out my own timeline of the project. </p>
			<p>In the future, I hope to continue this project by conducting more user research. Not only do I want to interview more users, but I would also like to interview small restaurant owners in order to learn about their needs and concerns. I would continue this project with redesigning more features and iterating upon them. I believe this project does not only apply to Uber Eats, but can be useful for other delivery applications as well. </p>
			<p>Overall, I am proud of this project! I learned a lot from it and was able to practice different skills and tools outside the classroom.</p>
